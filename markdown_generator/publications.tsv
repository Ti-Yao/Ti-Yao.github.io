2022-01-04	Physical Mechanisms of ESCRT-III–driven Cell Division	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)	Here we developed a physical model for the ESCRT-III–mediated division of archaeal cells, which despite their structural simplicity share machinery and evolutionary origins with eukaryotes. By comparing the dynamics of simulations with data collected from live cell imaging experiments, we propose that this branch of life uses a previously unidentified division mechanism.
